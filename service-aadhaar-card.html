          The Aadhaar Card has become the most widely used identity document in India. It serves as proof of identity and residence and is linked to essential services like banking, government subsidies, ration cards, pensions, and even mobile SIM cards. However, for villagers — especially the elderly, children, or newly moved families — applying for an Aadhaar card or updating its details can be a confusing and time-consuming process. With the E-Gram Panchayat web platform, this process is now simplified, user-friendly, and completely paperless.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:1rem;max-width:700px;">
          Through the Aadhaar Card Application service, users can apply for new Aadhaar enrollment or request changes such as name correction, address update, or mobile number linking. After logging in through the E-Gram Panchayat portal, the user can select the "Apply for Aadhaar Card" option from the list of services. The form asks for basic information like full name, date of birth, gender, existing Aadhaar number (if any), and details to be updated. Once filled, the form is submitted and securely saved to the Firebase database.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:1rem;max-width:700px;">
          The Panchayat staff or Aadhaar assistance officer can then view the submitted application, validate the data, and mark the request as "Pending", "Approved", or "Rejected" with comments if needed. This allows the user to track their request from home without worrying about follow-ups or delays. The system improves transparency, saves physical effort, and brings Aadhaar services to the village doorstep — exactly what the Digital India movement aims to achieve.

        <p style="margin-top:1rem;max-width:700px;">
          Whether it's a new application or an update, villagers can now do it in just a few clicks with guidance, speed, and convenience — ensuring that no citizen is left behind when it comes to digital identity.
