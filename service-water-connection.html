          Access to clean and safe water is a fundamental need and right for every citizen. In many villages, applying for a new water connection involves visiting the local Panchayat office, filling physical forms, arranging supporting documents, and waiting for several days — often with no clear update on the application status. To make this essential service easier and more transparent, the E-Gram Panchayat platform provides a simple online way to apply for a water connection from anywhere, using just a phone or computer.

        <p style="margin-top:1rem;max-width:700px;">
          The Water Connection feature in the E-Gram Panchayat system allows villagers to request a new water supply line for their homes in just a few minutes. After logging into the portal using their email and password, users are taken to a clean and user-friendly dashboard. From there, they can choose the "Apply for Water Connection" option. The form asks for basic but essential information such as the applicant's name, address, type of house (kutcha or pucca), and whether a previous connection exists. The form can be submitted with a single click, and the data is instantly stored in the Firebase Firestore database.

        <p style="margin-top:1rem;max-width:700px;">
          Once submitted, the application becomes visible to the Panchayat staff or officer who is logged into the admin panel. The officer can review the application, verify details, and update the status accordingly — for example: "Pending", "Approved", or "Rejected". This status is also updated live for the user, so they can check their application anytime without needing to visit the office or make calls.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:1rem;max-width:700px;">
          By digitizing this process, E-Gram Panchayat saves time, reduces manual errors, and brings government services directly to rural homes. What once took multiple visits and paperwork can now be done in under 5 minutes, with full visibility and transparency. This system not only empowers villagers but also improves the efficiency of Panchayat-level administration — one step closer to a truly Digital India.
